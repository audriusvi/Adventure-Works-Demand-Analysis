## Findings
When seeking an unusual distribution, a noteworthy situation arises in the offline sales of Canada and the USA for the year 2002. Canada and the USA were and remained (by 2005) the most important sales group, accounting for more than 70 percent of total sales.

The profit column for June 2002 appears anomalous. While the average monthly profit stands at $345,000, June sees a loss of $29,000.

A deeper look reveals that it occurred due to Mountain Bikes sales that led to 254K loss. In fact, it was all bike model Mountain-100. It was sold in 2 colors and 4 different frame sizes. We see that losses incurred in all cases.

The Mountain-100 model began sales in July 2001, coinciding with the launch of Adventure Works in the same month. Sales of the product ceased at the end of June 2002, after twelve months. Why did the sales stop? The primary reason was the introduction of two new Mountain bike models, the Mountain-200 and Mountain-300. Suddenly, the Mountain-100 became obsolete, leading to the decision to discontinue the product and conduct a clearance sale. All remaining units of this model were sold at a 35% discount, resulting in a considerable loss for that month.

Let's take a look at the sales performance trend in mountain bikes over the last three months. On the y-axis, you can see the number of products sold, while the x-axis represents the profit or loss of total sales during this period. Specifically, we are focusing on the Mountain-500 bike model.

It's interesting to note that the same model, but with different variations, resulted in different profit situations. In other words, while black bikes met production expectations, silver bikes were overstocked, leading to sales at a loss.

This illustrates the importance of identifying trends over time and understanding customer preferences

What's currently trending, and what production decisions should we make, particularly regarding color?

For most bike colors, sales correlate with overall bike sales. However, an interesting trend emerges in the sales of yellow and red bikes. Historically, we sold more red bikes than yellow, but this changed in June 2003.

Between June 2002 and June 2003, we sold over 10,000 red bikes, constituting 32% of all sales, compared to 3,400 yellow bikes, which accounted for 10% of all sales.

The following year, red bike sales dropped to just 1% of all sales, while yellow bike sales increased to 33% of all sales. It's evident that yellow is trending.

But what about red color? Should we introduce new models in red, or not? Let's consider another angle: the preferences of one of our customer groups, children.

In 2001, the University of Taiwan conducted research with the main purpose of understanding childrenâ€™s color preferences. The aim was to create attractive pictures for books, thereby increasing children's interest in reading. The research revealed that the most popular color among children is red, followed by blue and yellow.

On the right, you can see a possible selection of children's frame sizes for bikes at Adventure Works. We observe that clients are currently able to order silver, black, and yellow bikes. While yellow bikes align with children's expectations, black bikes do as well, at least partially.

However, it would be a great idea to introduce children's bikes in red and blue to the market, especially considering that changing the color is less technically complex than altering other bike specifications.

What we can improve?
The current selection of children's bikes is inadequate for the market; we should offer red and blue bikes.

Feedback is crucial for several reasons. Customer preferences are constantly evolving, and feedback helps us stay adaptable by providing insights into changing market trends and customer behaviors. However, we have very few reviews in our database, so it's essential that we work on this.

Adventure Works boasts 290 active employees, indicating a substantial workforce. With such diversity among our colleagues, each bringing various opinions and perspectives, they can contribute significantly to product selection and initial testing before products go into production.
